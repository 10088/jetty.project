===== Module `well-known`

The `well-known` creates a `ResourceHandler` deployed at the `/.well-known` context path.
This `Handler` serves files from a directory created at `${jetty.base}/.well-known`, note that this may be seen as a hidden directory by the filesystem.

The concept of well-known URIs has been defined in RFC5785.
It may be used for things like automation of the renewal for Let's Encrypt certificates.

The module file is `$JETTY_HOME/modules/well-known.mod`:
